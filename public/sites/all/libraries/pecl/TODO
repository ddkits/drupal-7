- Respect param precedence,
  * This ext does not currently care to respect parameter precedence, in the sense that if a common param is defined in POST/GET or Authorization header, the precendence is defined by: OAuth Core 1.0 section 9.1.1

- Add tests
  * need there be anymore said?

- Allow runtime setting of Expect header for POST requests
  * Don't know if always disabling the Expect header is going to have a big enough impact, if it does, we'll need to allow setting it dynamically for API's which can't handle it properly
